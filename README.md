- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m <div class="badge-base LI-profile-badge" data-locale="pt_BR" data-size="large" data-theme="dark" data-type="HORIZONTAL" data-vanity="patrÃ­cio-rios-7b9b93164" data-version="v1"><a class="badge-base__link LI-simple-link" href="https://br.linkedin.com/in/patr%C3%ADcio-rios-7b9b93164?trk=profile-badge">PatrÃ­cio Rios</a></div>
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in learning a little about each related area of programming and improving in the one I have the most affinity for.

- ðŸ’¼ My professional trajectory is based on customer service, good relationship with the team and dedication to the company. As an employee, always aiming for professional advancement, on merit, performing my duties to the letter and always studying the possibility of refining work techniques and tools and seeking to absolve all the knowledge made available by the company and co-workers.

  I'm going through a career transition, leaving the administrative area for the technology area, more precisely for the systems development area. I've always had curiosity and vocation to work with technologies and due to immaturity and ignorance, I ended up following different areas. I recently had the opportunity to walk this new path. I will work hard and study hard to enter the market and start this new chapter in my professional life.
